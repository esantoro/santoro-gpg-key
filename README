I am Emanuele Santoro, the blogger from http://santoro.tk .
Well, I've decided to use this little GIT repository to keep track of my
public key and of how it changes dureing the days of my life.

At the moment I start this repository (03-Dec-2008 , 11:13 p.m.) my
repository contains:
	* santoro.gpg
	* santoro.gpg.sig
	* santoro.gpg.asc
	* santoro.gpg.asc.sig
	* MD5SUM

Them are:
* santoro.gpg -> my gpg public key, binary version
* santoro.gpg.sig -> detached signature for the previous file
* santoro.gpg.asc -> my gpg public key, ascii-armored version
* santoro.gpg.asc.sig -> detached signature for the previous file
* MD5SUM -> md5sum of all the files (run md5sum -c MD5UM to verify)

So, feel free to clone the last snapshot of my GnuPG public key doing
somehing like that:

	$ git clone git://github.com/esantoro/santoro-gpg-key.git

Q: Why am I not using a OpenPGP Keyserver like keyserver.linux.it or
pgp.mit.edu ?
A: Answer is pretty short: keyservers are GLOBAL.
   I use GnuPG only since just 8 months and before uploading a key to a
   keyserver i want to get in control with GnuPG and public key
   criptography.

Q: So why are you using GitHUB and Git ?
A: Because they are more confortable than manualluy exporting my key,
   signing it and doing md5sum on them. I have scripts for automagically
   doing that.

Feel free to post any question to: manu@santoro.tk or
santoro@autistici.org .
